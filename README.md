PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

## Technologies
- Github Cloning
- Python
- Pandas
- MySQL
- mysql-connector-python
- Streamlit
- Plotly

## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data, process it to obtain insights, and visualize the information in a user-friendly manner.

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction:** Clone the Github repository to fetch the data.
2. **Data Transformation:** Use Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Database Insertion:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing the data.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the solution ensuring security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

## Results
The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard displaying insights from the PhonePe Pulse Github repository in an interactive manner. Users can access the dashboard from a web browser and explore different visualizations and facts.
